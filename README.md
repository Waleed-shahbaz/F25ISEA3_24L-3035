## 📘 Overview
This repository contains three C++ programs developed for *Introduction to Software Engineering (ISE) Assignment 3*.  
Each program demonstrates key Software Engineering principles such as **modularity**, **robustness**, **maintainability**, and **clarity**.

---

## 🧩 Q1 – Palindrome Checker
This program checks whether a given word or phrase is a **palindrome** — a sequence that reads the same backward and forward.  
It ignores case, spaces, and punctuation, allowing accurate checks for both simple and multi-word phrases.

### **Features**
- Handles both words and full phrases  
- Ignores spaces, case, and punctuation  
- Real-time input using `_getch()`  
- User can press **ESC** to exit anytime

---

## 🧠 Q2 – Hangman
A console-based **Hangman** game written in C++.  
The player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word randomly selected from a text file (`tech_companies.txt`).  
The player can make up to seven mistakes before losing.

### **Features**
- Reads words dynamically from a text file  
- Tracks guessed letters and remaining chances  
- Handles repeated and invalid inputs gracefully  
- Modular and structured for easy updates

## 🎯 Q3 – Tic Tac Toe
A two-player **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented in C++.  
Players take turns marking a 3×3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw.  
The game ensures fair play with valid move checks and automatic win detection.

### **Features**
- Console-based board with coordinate input  
- Validates moves to avoid overwriting cells  
- Detects winning and draw conditions automatically  
- Modular design with separate functions for grid display, input, and logic  

---

## 🏁 Notes
- All programs follow modular design and input validation principles.  
- Each demonstrates clarity, robustness, and anticipation of future extensions.  
- Repository submitted via GitHub in accordance with course requirements.
